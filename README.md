**Droping Columns which are not Required for Classification
**One hot encoding on Hazardous column
**Observing Unique Values in Orbiting Body and Equinox
**Both Columns can be dropped, as both have single one value present
**Correlation vis Heatmap
**Need to drop Some Columns as they are having correlation 1 because they are identical columns with a different unit.
**Now again but Final Heatmap Correlation
**Now as True Column is needed for our Classifications , therefore False column can be drop from dataset
**Finally We will Build Model
**XGBoost Classifier
**Final Accuracy Score
We can do more Classifications with Different Different Columns.
